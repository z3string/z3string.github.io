<h2>Constraint Generation / Conversion Tools</h2>

<h3>StringFuzz</h3>

<p><a href="http://stringfuzz.dmitryblotsky.com/">StringFuzz</a> is an instance transformer and generator for SMT-LIB instances with string and regex constraints.</p>

<h3>regex2smtlib</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/hycos/regex2smtlib">regex2smtlib</a> is a tool developed by Julian Thom&eacute; for generating constraints in SMT-LIB format from Perl-compatible regular expressions.</p>

<h2>Related Solvers</h2>

<h3>MathCheck</h3>

<p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mathcheck">MathCheck</a> is a combination of the computer algebra system (CAS) SAGE with a SAT solver. Users can define predicates in the language of the CAS, which can be finitely verified in a loop by the SAT solver, analogous to basic SMT approaches.</p>

<h3>MapleSAT</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/gsd.uwaterloo.ca/maplesat/maplesat">MapleSAT</a> series of SAT solvers are a family of conflict-driven clause-learning SAT solvers for solving the Boolean satisfiability problem. The key innovation of these solvers is the use of the learning rate branching heuristic (LRB), a departure from the VSIDS branching heuristic that has been the status quo for the past decade of SAT solving.</p>

<h3>STP</h3>

<p><a href="http://stp.github.io/">STP</a> is a constraint solver for the theory of quantifier-free bit-vectors that can solve many kinds of problems generated by program analysis tools, theorem provers, automated bug finders, cryptographic algorithms, intelligent fuzzers and model checkers.</p>

<h3>Hampi</h3>

<p><a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/akiezun/hampi/">Hampi</a> is a solver for string constraints. Hampi is designed for constraints generated by program analysis tools, automated bug finders, and intelligent fuzzers.<br />

Hampi constraints express membership in regular languages and bounded context-free languages. Hampi constraints may contain context-free-language definitions, regular-language definitions and operations, and the membership predicate. Given a set of constraints, Hampi outputs a string that satisfies all the constraints, or reports that the constraints are unsatisfiable.</p>
