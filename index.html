title: Z3 String Constraint Solver
---
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<b>Latest stable release: <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/Z3">Official Z3 Repository</a><b>

<p>Z3str3 is a constraint solver for the quantifier-free theory of string
equations, the regular-expression membership predicates, and linear
arithmetic over the length functions. Z3str3 is now part of the Z3
theorem prover's main codebase, and is the primary string solver in
  Z3.</p>

<p>The Z3str3 string solver is being actively developed in close
cooperation with the Z3 team at Microsoft Research. Additionally, this
research is being supported by IBM, Amazon, Google, and NSERC Canada
  through various grants, awards, and research collaborations.</p>
